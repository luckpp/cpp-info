## Templates

Templates are resolved at compile time.

## Operators
- << : insertion operator
- \>> : extraction operator

## Look for C++ types like
```c++
long long
usigned long
```
- note that: `auto nr = 1'000'000'000'000` (is a long long and uses digit separators introduced in C++14)
- digit separators can be used with any frequency and mean nothing (they are only for humans)
```c++
auto a = 0xFF; (int 255)
auto i = 0b111; (int 7)
```

## Constructor
- initialization list in constructor, does the initialization the right way, only one time before anything else
- in order to add a default contructor generated the same way as the compiler would have generated it:
```c++
public:
  Person() = default;
```		
- `RAII = Resource Aquisition Is Initialization` -> you aquire resources in the constructor and release them in the destructor

## Syntax for using-s
```c++
using std::string;
using std::endl;
```

## Enums
- **old style enums** which have the drawback that once a value has been defined no other enum can have that value (Start, Stop):
```c++
enum Status
{
	Start,
	Stop
};

// and you can use it:
Status s = Start;
```

- **scoped enums**:
```c++
enum class CarStatus
{
	Start,
	Stop
};
enum class BikeStatus
{
	Start,
	Stop
};

// and you can use it
CarStatus cs = CarStatus::Start;
```

## Functions
- whenever passing a parameter by reference, prefere to pass it by const reference:
```c++
bool IsPrime(int const& number);
```

- passing a literal to a function can be done by value or by const& (normal reference & would not work)
```c++
template T max<class T>(T const& t1, T const& t2);
// ...
max(1, 2);
```

## Templates specialization
- it is possible to make a template act differently for a type (that you do not want or do not can to enhance with an operator)
```c++
template <>
class Accum<Person>
{
private:
	int total:
public:
	Accum(int number) : total(number) {}
	int operator+=(Person const& p) // the operator is defined in Accum NOT in Person
	{
		return total += p.getNumber();
	}
}
```

## References
- you can set the target only when you delcare the reference
- all actions to the target go through the reference
- can not be made to refere to something else
- when pointing to a literal it has to be a const&:
	- int const& ra = 3;

## Pointers
- 'nullptr' is modern C++ keyword to indicate null pointer:
	- 0 can be used (or the macro NULL which is an int) but can lead to confusion since 0 is an int -> so whe you want to pass a null pointer to a function that has a int overload, the int overload will be called
- can be null
- can be reinitialized
- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT USES OF POINTES IS:
	- TO ACCESS MEMORY KNOWN AS THE FREE STORE (THE HEAP)


## Const
- const before or const after does not influence the compiler, it is only for people
- int const* p; // -> points to something that can not change
- unt * const p; // -> p can not be made to point to something else


## MEMORY MANAGEMENT
- deleting a nullptr is safe:
	int* ptr = new int(i);
	delete ptr;
	ptr = nullptr;
	delete nullptr; // this is safe
	
	
1. The Rule of THREE
- destructor: that deletes what has been created with 'new'
```c++
~Employee()
```

- copy constructor: should create a deep copy of the object (so you 'new'-up another resource for that object, and te resource can be safely deleted):
```c++
Employee employee = oldemployee;
Employee(Employee const& e);
```

- copy assignment operator: this needs to initialize the new thing you are making a copy of AND clean up any existing value that was in:
```c++
oldemployee2 = oldemployee3;
// in this case the resource that was in oldemployee2 has to be deleted
// tanyou make a new resource and put values in it from oldemployee3
Employee& operator=(Employee const& e)
```
	
- NOTE: it is up to you if you want to create deep copies or you want to share some objects
	
When you introduce the ideea of moving: if you have an object that has a resource that is expensive, and the object is going out of scope, you can move that expensive resource into another object rather than deleting it and creating a new one from scratch.

2. The rule of five:
	- move constructor
	- move assignment operator
	
3. The rule of Zero in C++14 C++17:
	- you design your calass so that you do not need anyone of the above
	- so you rely on stack semantics or value semantics
		- so you relay on a class from the library to do the resource management 
	
	
## Smart pointers
- `unique_ptr`
	- very low overhead
	- can not be copied (use std::move when you want for example to put it into a collection)
	- cleans up the heap when it goes out of scope
	- for example, a factory function that creates a new Foo and returns it should do so as a unique_ptr<Foo> not a Foo*. Likewise, a function that takes ownership of a Foo should accept a unique_ptr<Foo> parameter. not Foo*.
	std::make_unique(...); // the prefered way, will call new
- `shared_ptr`
	- can be copied
	- reference counting
	std::make_shared(...); // the prefered way, will call new
- `weak_ptr`
	- lets you "peek" at a shared_ptr without bumping the reference count
	- has to be used with caution and tested before use
	- it does not bump the reference count


## Polymorphism
- once you have a VIRTUAL function in your class, make the destructotr VIRTUAL as well
- the opposed to polymorphism is SLICING:
	- this can happen when you have an inheritance herarchy and you pass parameters by value or you copy
  ```c++
	-->> void foo(Base b);
		 Derived d;
		 Base & rb = d;
		 foo(rb); // slicing occurs and only the Base part of 'd' is being cpoied
	-->> void foo(Base cons& b); // use a reference instead in order to have polymorphism
	

## Casts
- static_cast<>: occures at runtime and should be perform if you reason that this is correct:
	- it can only be done between related types
	double d = 3.14;
	int i = static_cast<int>(d);
- dynamic_cast<>: performed at run-time and is based on virtual table
	- if caast can not be performed it returns a nullptr if cast fails
- const_cast<>: casts away the constnes of an object
	- it is not modern
- reinterpret_cast<>: reinterprets the bytes of an object
	- it is very dangerous
	
NOTE: casting smart pointers can be done with operators like:
- std::static_pointer_cast
- std::dynamic_pointer_cast
- std::const_pointer_cast
- std::reinterpret_pointer_cast
