## Compilers
- VC++, g++, clang


## Compiler errors
- in Visual Studio go to Output window -> click the error code -> press F1


## Variables
```c++
auto a = 10; // auto is a request to the compiler to determine the type of the variable
```

## Loops

```c++
vector<int> vi;
//...
for (auto item : vi) // range based for -> new in C++11
{
	cout << item;
}
```

## Constructor

```c++
Account acct(); // this is a function declaration that thakes no params and returns an Account, not an object instance creation (even if Account is a class)
```


## Includes

```cpp
#pragma once // only on windows
```
- makes sure that things are not included multiple times (no multiple declarations)

## Makefiles

- example is available in SimpleClasses solution


## Casting

- static_cast<> ( int i = (int)4.9; | same as | int i = static_cast<int>(4.9) )
- dynamic_cast<>
- const_cast<>
- reinterpret_cast<>
-> NOTE: the old-style cast is equivalent to all casts above


## Optimization

- 'const' can make things faster
	- it is important to do 'const' early in the project in order to make things simpler
- pass object by reference (avoids copying it):
	int Print(Transaction& t);
OR  int Print(const Transaction& t); // put const to make sure you intent is not to change the obj
